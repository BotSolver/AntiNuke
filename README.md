## What is AntiNuke?

A Open Source Discord Anti Nuke Bot to stop **Raids**, **Nuking**, and **Mass Dms**.

**ONLY THE RELEASE VERSION WORKS AT THE MOMENT**

## Common Issue's

When it is installing it's modules and dll's, do **NOT** forcefully close it from running in the background, it was made to be that way to look better.

If the bot doesn't go online, you did something wrong, just change the config settings.
