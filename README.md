## What is This AntiNuke Bot?

A Open Source Discord AntiNuke Bot to stop **Raids**, **Nuking**, and **Mass Dms**.

**ONLY THE RELEASE VERSION WORKS AT THE MOMENT**

## Common Issue's

Edited 11/5/22: Forgot to say this with the start bot file in the release, there will be a popup saying windows has protected your pc, since this is a new file and bot it says that since it's not commonly downloaded, just press more info and run anyways to start the bot, no need to turn off antivirus.

When it is installing it's modules and dll's, do **NOT** forcefully close it from running in the background, it was made to be that way to look better.

If the bot doesn't go online you did something wrong, just change the config settings.

### How To Use

1. Download the AntiNuke program and unzip the files. 
2. Open the config.json file with a text editor and fill in all the required information. This includes your Discord token, your Discord server ID, and the role ID of the role you want to assign to users who pass the anti-nuke test.
3. Save the changes to the config.json file and close the text editor. 
4. Open the "Start Bot.exe" file to launch the AntiNuke program.
5. Configure the bot for your Discord server by typing the "config" command into the chat. This will set up the anti-nuke test and assign the role to users who pass it.
6. The AntiNuke program is now ready for use. Invite users to your Discord server and have them take the anti-nuke test. If they pass, they will be assigned the role you specified.
