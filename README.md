## What is This AntiNuke Bot?

A Open Source Discord AntiNuke Bot to stop **Raids**, **Nuking**, and **Mass Dms**.

**ONLY THE RELEASE VERSION WORKS AT THE MOMENT**

## Common Issue's

Edited 11/5/22: Forgot to say this with the start bot file in the release, there will be a popup saying windows has protected your pc, since this is a new file and bot it says that since it's not commonly downloaded, just press more info and run anyways to start the bot, no need to turn off antivirus.

**Also you can't have 2fa on the bot you use as it messes with the connection to the bot and makes the bot not turn on, if this is the case, turn off 2fa on the discord account (you can keep phone number on), and restart your computer. if this isn't done I've seen it sends false backup codes notifications to the email of the account, odn't worry about them as it just means you messed up.**

When it is installing it's modules and dll's, do **NOT** forcefully close it from running in the background, it was made to be that way to look better.

If the bot doesn't go online you did something wrong, just change the config settings.

### How To Use

1. Make sure 2fa on the account you made the bot on is off, leave the phone number on if you want.
2. Download the config the config.json.
3. STart the bot.
4. Setup the bot in the server.
5. You're all good now!
